public_2033.fits is the catalog of the quads from OM10 used in Chao et al. 2019. public_2033.fits includes the point properties of the quasar in the source plane (from OM10), singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass profiles of the lens galaxy from OM10, and Sérsic light profiles of the lens galaxy selected by Chao et al. 2019. For the stochastic quasar source light curves and the random host galaxy Sérsic light profiles, which are not included in public_2033.fits, one could generate them following Chao et al. 2019.
